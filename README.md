## 🔧 Building

```bash
make clean && make
```

This creates three executables:
- `train` - Training program
- `prediction` - Prediction program  
- `test` - Model evaluation program

## 📖 Usage

### Training
```bash
# Basic training
./train data/data.csv

# With normalization (recommended)
./train data/data.csv --norm

# Custom learning rate
./train data/data.csv --norm --learning-rate 0.05

# Help
./train --help
```

### Prediction
```bash
./prediction
# Interactive mode - enter feature values to get predictions
```

### Model Evaluation
```bash
# Test on training data
./test

# Test on separate dataset
./test data/test_data.csv

# Custom model file
./test data/test_data.csv my_model.txt
```

## � Model Performance

| Method | R² Score | RMSE | MAE | Quality |
|--------|----------|------|-----|---------|
| With Normalization | 0.733 | 668 | 558 | GOOD |
| Without Normalization | -8.21 | 3920 | 3516 | POOR |

## 🧮 Algorithm Details

### Gradient Descent Formula
```
θⱼ := θⱼ - α × (1/m) × Σ(hθ(x⁽ⁱ⁾) - y⁽ⁱ⁾) × xⱼ⁽ⁱ⁾
```

### Feature Normalization
```
x_norm = (x - μ) / σ
```
Where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

## 🔍 Key Components

### Linear Regression Class (`lr.hpp`)
- Gradient descent implementation
- Training with configurable learning rate and iterations
- Cost function monitoring
- Parameter optimization

### Matrix Operations (`Matrix.hpp`, `MVector.hpp`)
- Custom matrix and vector classes
- Mathematical operations for linear algebra
- Memory management

### CSV Processing (`csv_to_matrix.hpp`)
- Automatic CSV parsing
- Flexible format support (last column as target)

## 📈 Error Metrics

The test program provides comprehensive evaluation:
- **MSE**: Mean Squared Error
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error  
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Always use normalization** for features with different scales
2. **Start with learning rate 0.1** for normalized data
3. **Use very small learning rates** (1e-12) for non-normalized data
4. **Monitor cost function** convergence during training
5. **Evaluate on separate test data** for realistic performance assessment

This project is part of the 42 curriculum for learning machine learning fundamentals.

1. **Initialize weights** (usually to 0 or small random values).
2. **Compute predictions** using the current weights.
3. **Calculate the cost function** (typically MSE).
4. **Compute gradients** of the cost with respect to each weight.
5. **Update weights** using the gradient descent update rule.
6. **Repeat** steps 2–5 until convergence or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

## ✅ When to Use Gradient Descent

- Large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces.
- Online or mini-batch learning scenarios.
- Preference for iterative optimization methods.
